You made your hair straight
For our little date.
I saw it once and a second time;
To see you in that state,
It made those days great.
Is it really a crime
To know you did it out of love and not hate?
Is this really our fate?

Now, I won't see the braids or the twists or the curls
Unless I go and seek them out on other girls,
Unless I sneak you out and take you on a whirl,
Unless I bust open the clam to see the pearl.

Would it be worth it? Yes.

To see the best creation on Earth, I guess
Anything's justified to release the stress
Of not daily seeing your finesse.
I'm depressed already, I confess.

I miss your tender love and care.
I miss just having you there.
I miss your exotic touch, your flair.
I miss your hair.
