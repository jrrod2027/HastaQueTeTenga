You were the first thing in the morning I thought 
Last thing I felt fore I dropped
And I was taught I ought not to
But every dream of past or future all consisted of all of you
I tried to be appalled by you
But if I’m gonna be fair, every feeling laid bare, even every prayer I sent up to God was so down for you
I thought I could make it all better if I made my heart and my head and my body go far
But the problem is you weren’t just on my mind then, you still are
