Today, I emerged from a desert place
And travelled a path I remembered well
To a lake filled with amity and grace.
Instead of an oasis, I found Hell.

A lone duck wanders about a crater —
Which lies, shameless, in my beloved’s bed —
Seeking fruit only the lake could cater.
Spiteful Wind blew dust in my eyes, and said:

“How pathetic! To see a young man cry
About that which is not and won’t be his,
Foolishly mistaking the lake now dry
With fountains that could keep their promises!”

Her beauty and glory ruthlessly stripped,
I see her bare, so fruitlessly unclipped.
