I envy every eye that gets EMP,
that gets to see 
the seat of all my sin and suffering,
set squarely on your scarlet cheeks.
I am a coward.
I lack the courage to contemplate
your constantly condescending countenance.
For me, your face is so much fouler
than any fake, frenetic feelings
Iâ€™ve fabricated with my fountain pen.
But then again, my lies were never lonely,
forming legions to make the holy
wholly languish.
Still, chances are slim
that you could stumble upon
someone else who would even
set you aside as sacred.
With holy hands, I pray 
you only let me live
to learn your love.
I know, I know that meaningless
are all my myriad methods
For maintaining meaning without you,
meaning without merriment.
But compared to 
my intermittent mirth,
my loyal melancholy makes me
much more deeply moved.
