Beautiful… God’s creation reflects His power, wisdom, and His aesthetic and artistic prowess. God engineered the natural phenomena of gravity, radiation, refraction, visual perception, and even our cognition in such a way that we can not only see the grandeur of the world around us, but also FEEL it deep down in our bones. Whenever I see the sky, I become profoundly aware of God’s presence and profoundly grateful that such a powerful Being would care about me. God orchestrates the stars in their orbits so that they play out dramas in the sky. He coordinates the weather all over the world, ensuring seed time and harvest every year like He promised in His Word. But He also remembers to keep every mitochondrion and nucleus of every cell in our bodies functioning so that we can live another day. God is in charge of the big details in our lives, but still has time to focus on perfecting the minutiae.
Just think about the fact that the same God who made the sunrise, and who made everything else in our intricate universe, also made you and me. No wonder you’re so beautiful!
