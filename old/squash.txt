Congratttsssss!!!! 
You made it on the team!
There was no doubt for me,
Because for you, 
nothing’s hard as it may seem.
Wish I’d been there to see,
To feel the feeling too,
To enjoy your face, see you beam 
When they called your name.
But i am happy all the same
That they recognized your greatness.
Now nobody thinks you’re lame.
Now your reputation’s stainless.
I pray for you that you stay blameless, 
And that, just like this
you keep on achieving 
all your aims and dreams!
