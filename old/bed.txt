I know it is wrong; I am so selfish!
Your every second I want to reserve.
Your smile I have seen much less than I wish,
But, we both know, much more than I deserve.

I rest in my bed, knowing you were here;
Your luscious scent engulfs me in my sheets.
Constantly aching and empty, I fear,
Is pain when a man such a beauty meets.

I reach out for your hands â€” Oh, what a cope!
Except your fingerprints, I am bereft.
The ring on your right hand gave me such hope, 
Reflects the one I shall put on your left.

So precious is the time we spend apart;
Each second tests and fortifies my heart.
