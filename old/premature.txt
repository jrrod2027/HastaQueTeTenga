A year with you: the time flew
So fast, I know that we will last.
I knew, I loved you,
But who knew, it’d be such a blast
To be part of this entity called us, Your
fidelity makes me trust. 
You’re the melody that just 
loops in my head forever.
No matter the weather, 
Our love is a tether for two.
I know it’s fate,
I just can’t wait 
to spend another year with you.
