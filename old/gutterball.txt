You’re my only sleeping beauty;
I want to embrace you in bed.
To let you sleep is my duty,
But I can’t forget what you said.

When you wake up you’ll be all mine!
I stare longingly at your lips.
Baby, you’re incredibly fine.
I rest my fingers on your hips.

Your eyelids begin to flutter;
My mind jumps right in the gutter.
