Is it gravity at work between us,
The same force which guides the moon and the sun,
Which dictates how Mars must play with Venus?
Is that push threatening to make us one?

But does Earth escape the apple it pulls
Just as you seek to hide from my embrace?
The moon rocks the tides, and the waves it lulls,
But you desert me with dizzying pace.

What Newton neglected to see, I saw:
Some attracted bodies repel their pair.
The law of attraction has but one flaw;
It assumes reciprocal love and care.

Scientific approaches to you fail.
I canâ€™t understand why you make me wail.
