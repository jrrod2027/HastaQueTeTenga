I thank the Lord she makes my hands strong when my knees weak
I’m ready to work for her like Jacob
Even when the day’s long, I think of night when she’ll need me
Every curse for her turns to blessings like Balaam
They wonder why I don’t hate them
Didn’t need a million to set our foundation
Didn’t wander far to find my amazing
They think it’s silly I like her more without her foundation
