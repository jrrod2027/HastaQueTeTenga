You should have let me wallow where I lay
In my sickening mud, that sinful clay
When did I roll off the path on my way?
You love this nasty pig enough to stay

Why should a queen play with a dirty swine?
How could God’s justice and His love combine?
Are you just perfect or is this a sign
God made you for me, that’s why you’re divine?

“I let the devil take control of me!”
I can’t blame him for my salacity
Your misgivings I was too blind to see
That fault lies not with him but all with me

I don’t know how I can fix or repay
“I’m sorry” is just too easy to say
It won’t brighten such a terrible day
It won’t even make the pain go away

But it’s all I have right now: I’m sorry
