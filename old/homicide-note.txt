Each time my phone shivers in anticipation,
I pray it got the chills from you.
I get high off each daily salutation;
You could say I get my pills from you.
I’m wary of every form of compensation
Unless I get the bills from you.
Music flows like percussive revelation;
I get all my fills from you.
I learned I hate learning all alone.
I’m most happy when I’m skilled by you.
For you, I can change what’s set in stone.
I want to live in the world willed by you.
Reap me as if I were what you’ve sown,
No need for me to be tilled by you.
I wrote a homicide note in my phone.
If I die, it means I was killed by you.
