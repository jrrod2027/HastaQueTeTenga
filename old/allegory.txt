This is allegory 

Like a stray stiletto through the heel of Achilles
Like Delilah’s supercuts brought Sampson to his knees
Like stomping that concrete rose spilt the blood of Biggie
Louis Lane was my kryptonite, it wasn’t pretty

When I initiated my affiliation with that shorty from across the hall
She explained she was an official extracurricular; I got all involved 
I heard from some friends - two or ten or forty - that I dropped the ball
But honestly after that frigid fall,
I was happy I had a girl at all

Although Epicurus might squabble with my use of “happy”
Our relationship brought me much less pleasure than it did pain 
She never kissed or missed me, never loved me, nothing so sappy
She made sure to wipe me away before I ever left a stain

I hope this this summer
I lose some weight but gain some muscle and some needed self-respect

That I learn to cut out all the lusting after weedy Baphomet

With smoke and mirrors she turned cussing into TS Elliot

But that was all up in my head, she’s uglier than you’d expect

I needed wisdom from above to teach me love’s not the sum of all my urges
And that lesson hurted, I think I howled from the pain and all my friends and family heard it
It’s absurd that I so often lapped Lake Lag but could not infer that the trees had conspired against me like InVERness

Or was it InverNESS, I guess I didn’t read Macbeth that closely, I confess
All the death, though fictional and mostly meaningless, had its effect, a mark it left on middle school me

Maybe the mimetic poetry we conceive testifies to more verities than flashing lights on our screens, which have perfect parity to images we daily see with our eyes
I realized I could find more solace in Dante’s Paradise than in any thirst trap Instagram could devise

But that’s if you make it past infierno
You think it’s hot but I cleared mine en el invierno

Because sometimes stories and allegories have more depth than truth does and truly set me free

I hate moralisms and clichés
I have never read Dante or listened to Tupac Shakur
I’ve never had a girl, much less one with bougie couture
It’s all been a lie but of this much I’m sure
Without writing I wouldn’t be alive, and that’s what it’s for
